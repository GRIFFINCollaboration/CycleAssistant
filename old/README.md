CycleAssistant
==============

CycleAssistant is a widget in the [GRIFFIN Toolkit](http://trshare.triumf.ca/~wjmills/GRIFFIN/GRIFFINtoolkit/) family of tools.  Users can define a beam cocktail, from which an activity profile is generated for the duration of their experiment, and for some time afterwards.
